{"chunk":"What Is ALT?ALT is an enzyme that helps convert proteins into energy. While its major activity occurs in the liver, smaller amounts are found in the kidneys, heart, muscles, and pancreas. Typically, ALT levels in the blood are low. However, when liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream, leading to elevated levels.","book":"ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase): Levels and Health Impacts"}
