{"chunk":"Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small blood cells. They form in your bone marrow, the sponge-like tissue in your bones. Platelets are essential for blood clotting. A blood clot is a mass of blood that forms when platelets, proteins, and cells in the blood stick together. When you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the","book":"Platelet Tests"}

{"chunk":"There are two types of platelet tests: a platelet count test and platelet function tests.\n\nA platelet count test measures the number of platelets in your blood:","book":"Platelet Tests"}
{"chunk":"A lower-than-normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. This condition can cause you to bleed too much after a cut or other injury that causes bleeding.\nA higher-than-normal platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This can make your blood clot more than you need it to. Blood clots can be dangerous because they can block blood flow.","book":"Platelet Tests"}

{"chunk":"During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.","book":"Platelet Tests"}
