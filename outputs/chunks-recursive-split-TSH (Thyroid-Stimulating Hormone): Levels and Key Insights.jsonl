{"chunk":"When the thyroid gland is functioning properly, it produces two key hormones: T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). These hormones are released into the bloodstream and influence almost every cell in the body, helping regulate how the body uses energy, maintains body temperature, and ensures that organs function correctly.","book":"TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone): Levels and Key Insights"}
{"chunk":"TSH acts as a messenger between the pituitary gland and the thyroid gland. When the body needs more thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland releases more TSH into the bloodstream. This signals the thyroid gland to produce and release more T3 and T4. Conversely, if there is an excess of thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland reduces TSH production,","book":"TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone): Levels and Key Insights"}
