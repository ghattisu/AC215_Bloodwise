{"chunk":"What Is Total Protein?Total protein is a measure of the overall amount of protein present in your blood. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body, such as building tissues, transporting substances, and fighting infections. The two main types of protein measured are albumin and globulin.","book":"Total Protein: Key Roles, Levels, and Health Impacts"}
{"chunk":"Albumin helps transport hormones and nutrients, while globulin plays a key role in the immune system.

{"chunk":"How Is Total Protein Testing Conducted?Total protein is measured through a blood test, which is part of several broader tests, such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or a basic metabolic panel (BMP). During the test, a small blood sample is taken from a vein in your arm and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\nPreparation for the Test","book":"Total Protein: Key Roles, Levels, and Health Impacts"}
