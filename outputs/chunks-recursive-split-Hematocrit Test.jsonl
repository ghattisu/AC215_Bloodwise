{"chunk":"A hematocrit test is a blood test that measures how much of your blood is made up of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. The other parts of your blood include white blood cells (to help fight infection), platelets (to help make blood clots to stop bleeding), and a liquid called plasma.","book":"Hematocrit Test"}
{"chunk":"Hematocrit levels that are too high or too low can be a sign of a blood disorder, dehydration, or other medical conditions that affect your blood.\n\nOther names: HCT, packed cell volume, PCV, Crit;; H and H (Hemoglobin and Hematocrit)","book":"Hematocrit Test"}

It may also be used to help diagnose blood disorders, including anemia, a condition in which you don't have enough red blood cells, and polycythemia, an uncommon disorder in which you have too many red blood cells and your blood becomes too thick.","book":"Hematocrit Test"}
{"chunk":"Why do I need a hematocrit test?\nYour health care provider may order a hematocrit test as part of your regular checkup or to monitor your health if you are being treated for cancer or have an ongoing health condition. Your provider may also order this test if you have symptoms of a red blood cell disorder, such as anemia or polycythemia:","book":"Hematocrit Test"}
{"chunk":"Symptoms of anemia (too few red blood cells) may include:\n\nShortness of breath\nWeakness or fatigue\nHeadache\nDizziness\nArrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\nSymptoms of polycythemia (too many red blood cells) may include:","book":"Hematocrit Test"}

{"chunk":"What happens during a hematocrit test?\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.","book":"Hematocrit Test"}
{"chunk":"Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nYou don't need any special preparations for a hematocrit test. If your provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.","book":"Hematocrit Test"}
{"chunk":"Are there any risks to the test?\nThere is very little risk to having a hematocrit test or other type of blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.","book":"Hematocrit Test"}
{"chunk":"What do the results mean?\nYour hematocrit test results are reported as a number. That number is the percentage of your blood that's made of red blood cells. For example, if your hematocrit test result is 42, it means that 42% of your blood is red blood cells and the rest is white blood cells, platelets, and blood plasma.","book":"Hematocrit Test"}

{"chunk":"Shock\nIf your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Living at high altitudes where there's less oxygen in the air may cause a high hematocrit. That's because your body responds to low oxygen levels by making more red blood cells so that you get the oxygen you need.","book":"Hematocrit Test"}
{"chunk":"Pregnancy can cause a low hematocrit. That's because the body has more fluid than normal during pregnancy, which decreases the percentage that's made of red blood cells.\n\nTo learn what your test results mean, talk with your provider.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.","book":"Hematocrit Test"}
