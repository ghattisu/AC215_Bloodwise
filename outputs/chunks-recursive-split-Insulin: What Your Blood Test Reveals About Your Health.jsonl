{"chunk":"What Is Insulin?Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. It helps regulate blood sugar levels by allowing glucose to enter cells for energy.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health"}
{"chunk":"After eating, carbohydrates break down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream. The pancreas releases insulin, which signals cells to absorb glucose. This lowers blood sugar levels and provides energy to cells.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health"}
{"chunk":"Insulin ensures balanced blood sugar levels. It helps store excess glucose in the liver, muscles, and fat cells for later use. Proper insulin function supports overall health by preventing high and low blood sugar levels.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health"}
{"chunk":"Insulin as a BiomarkerInsulin levels in the blood serve as an important biomarker for metabolic conditions. High insulin levels can indicate insulin resistance, while low levels may suggest issues with insulin production.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health"}

{"chunk":"Type 1 Diabetes: An autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require insulin injections to manage their blood sugar levels.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health"}
{"chunk":"Type 2 Diabetes: Characterized by insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production. Management includes lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, and sometimes medication to improve insulin sensitivity.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health"}
{"chunk":"Gestational Diabetes: Occurs during pregnancy due to hormonal changes causing insulin resistance. It typically resolves after childbirth but can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health"}
{"chunk":"Insulin Resistance and Its ImplicationsInsulin resistance occurs when cells in muscles, fat, and the liver do not respond well to insulin, causing the pancreas to produce more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Over time, this can lead to type 2 diabetes and other health issues like high blood pressure and heart disease.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health"}
