{"chunk":"What Is Hemoglobin A1c?Hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c, is a form of hemoglobin that binds to glucose in the blood. It reflects the average blood sugar (glucose) levels over the past two to three months, providing a long-term view of blood sugar control. Hemoglobin A1c is a crucial biomarker in diagnosing and managing diabetes and prediabetes.","book":"Hemoglobin A1c: Key Functions, Levels, and Health Impact"}
