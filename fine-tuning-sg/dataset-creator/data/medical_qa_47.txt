    "question": "I'm concerned about my high cholesterol levels. What does a high LDL cholesterol level mean, and how can I lower it naturally?",
    "answer": "Good day, I'm your medical guide for interpreting these test results.  High cholesterol, particularly high LDL cholesterol, often called 'bad' cholesterol, can increase the risk of heart disease.  A healthy total cholesterol level is generally below 200 mg/dL.

This type of fiber can help reduce cholesterol absorption.  Also, incorporate heart-healthy fats like those found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts.  Remember, small, consistent changes in your diet can lead to significant improvements in your cholesterol levels.  It's important to combine these dietary changes with regular exercise.
