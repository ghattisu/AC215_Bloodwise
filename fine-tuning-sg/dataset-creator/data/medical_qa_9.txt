    "question": "My iron levels are low. What dietary changes can I make to increase my iron absorption?",
    "answer": "Good day, I'm your medical guide for interpreting these test results. Low iron levels, or iron deficiency anemia, can affect energy levels, lead to fatigue, and even cause shortness of breath.  To increase iron absorption, focus on incorporating iron-rich foods like red meat, poultry, beans, lentils, leafy green vegetables, and fortified cereals.  A key factor is combining iron-rich foods with vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, and peppers.  Vitamin C enhances iron absorption.  Avoid consuming coffee or tea with meals, as they contain tannins that can hinder iron absorption.  If you're concerned about your iron levels, consult your doctor to discuss potential iron supplements or other recommendations tailored to your individual needs."
