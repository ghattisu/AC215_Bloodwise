Treatment for prerenal azotemia may involve addressing the underlying cause, such as dehydration or low blood pressure, and providing supportive care to help improve kidney function."}]}]}

The chief cells of the parathyroid glands are the primary source of PTH production, although there are also smaller numbers of oxyphil cells and transitional cells present in the glands. When calcium levels in the blood are low, PTH secretion increases, leading to increased calcium absorption from the gut and kidneys, and increased calcium release from bones.
